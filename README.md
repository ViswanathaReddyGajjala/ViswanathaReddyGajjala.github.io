My primary focus is on computer vision and deep learning. I have worked on a variety of projects in object detection, segmentation,
incremental learning,  biometrics, face recognition  (facial attributes prediction), sketches, video machine learning. 

Recently, I've been exploring time series data analysis. Some works are highlighted here.
